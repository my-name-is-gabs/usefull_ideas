When I was a kid, I didn't have an interest in writing. I found it unappealing and boring, to be honest. But then I found myself writing random thoughts or creating short stories. Back in my elementary days, when I was required to submit an essay or a poem in English class as well as in Filipino, it was quite difficult for me to start writing. But once I started, I found myself immersed and unable to stop. Gradually, I became interested in writing. I found it appealing, and I was amazed by how powerful writing is, as it has the power to connect with the world and engage the imagination.

Over the years, my interest in writing has been growing. I write to express emotions, explore ideas, and share insights. Whether it's reflecting on everyday life, writing gives me a sense of clarity and enjoyment.

I am excited about the opportunity to join <Bits and Bytes> as an associate <writer?> because I believe in the power of collective voices. I'm drawn to spaces where writers learn from each other and contribute to something larger than themselves.

By being part of <Bits and Bytes>, I hope to both grow as a writer and help create content that inspires others. I'm eager to contribute thoughtful, engaging pieces and to be part of a team that celebrates the individual's artistic world
